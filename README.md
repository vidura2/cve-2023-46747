# Usage
Command-line Options

```
python exploit.py -u <target_url> [-t <proxy_url>]
```
# Example
```
python exploit.py -u https://192.168.1.100:8443 -t http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
Parameters
```
-u	(Required) Target URL of the F5 BIG-IP TMUI system.
-t	Proxy server (optional), e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080.
```
# How It Works

    Generate Credentials: Randomly generates a username and password.
    User Creation: Attempts to create a new user on the target using a specially crafted request.
    Token Retrieval: Logs in with the new user to obtain a session token.
    Command Execution: Executes arbitrary commands via the token.

# Key Functions

    generatesth(num): Generates random alphanumeric strings of length num.
    unauth_create_user(target, username, password, proxy): Creates a user on the target system.
    get_token(target, user, passwd, proxy): Retrieves an authentication token for the created user.
    exec_command(target, token, cmd, proxy): Executes arbitrary commands on the target system.
